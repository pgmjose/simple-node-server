    <h2>Top Picks: A Blog of my Bests and Greatests</h2>
    
    <em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em>
    
    <p> Firt on my list would have to be this year's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvLVWTaUT5w"> That Thing Called Tadhana</a> because it shows honesty in the proverb: "No man is an island." And that is exactly what the film depicted. Anthony made sure that Mace, a complete stranger to him, was alright when she was in the stage of crashing and burning after a break-up. I was also able to relate to some of the metaphors presented such as a museum exhibit, overweight luggage and excess baggage at an ariport and a symbolic out-of-town escapade. The use of casual, relatable and realistic everyday language was also a bonus.</p> 
    
    <br>
    
    <p> Next would be last year's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYKGY2NrBYY"> Starting Over Again</a>. Aside from being a Toni Gonzaga fan (haha #jeje!), it shows how a student-teacher relationship can be successful against many odds. Hahaha kidding. What I liked about the film was its great lighting, relatable scenarios and awesome cinematography. I felt the extra effort in every aspect of the production and perhaps that is why it was such a successful hit.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p> Last on my top picks would be the ultimate break-up movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmuQJg6ZTRU"> One More Chance</a>. This movie seriously set the standards for all romantic-comedy films in the country. I particularly liked how the film's cinematography tackled the answers to some hard-hitting questions regarding relationships, even those outside of romantic ones. I appreciated how it showed the importance of a strong foundational friendship as a root and saving grace for almost everything in life. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p> P.S. I'm not a jejemon (hahahaha!). I just really enjoyed watching these films because I appreciate Pinoy talent and everything is much better when said in Filipino. <em> Mas tagos!</em> Hahaha.</p>

    <em>The Top 3 Songs of My Playlist</em>
    
    <br>
    
   <p>And now to further prove to you that I am not a jejemon, I've picked only international songs here, but only from one artist, <strong>TAYLOR SWIFT</strong>. I am a Swiftie and I don't know if that make your impression of me better or worse. Hahaha! Oh well. NO REGRETS HEHE.</p>
   
   <br>
   
   <p>First on my list would be the LSS-inducing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ORhEE9VVg"> Blank Space</a>. I honestly do not know anyone who did not have this song stuck in his or her head for weeks. Hahaha. It's a shame that Taylor didn't release it as a single before releasing her album. The sales of that single track would've made her evern more richer than she already is. Hahaha. Moving on as to why I liked the song, it's actually quite simple. It's a fun and catchy song, one that you would catch yourself uncosciously singing in the shower or walking to class. I rarely search for the lyrics of a song, but in this one I did. It's hard to misinterpret lyrics hahaha case in point being the starbucks lovers hahaha!!! </p>
   
   <br>
   
   <p> Next would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk"> Style</a>. I did a few research work regarding the song (hahaha i know right, hahaha you can stop laughing now hehe) and the song is designed and programmed for you to like it because of the happy notes and chords used, the instruments building up to a usual and sure pop music hit, and the mysterious gossip-inducing lyrics. And those are exactly what I fell for and got me so hooked to this song!!! In fact, right now as I'm doing this exercise, I'm listening to it on loop. Hehe. I guess my main point would be I love this song so much because of the instant good vibes it imparts on me.</p>
   
   <br>
   
   <p> Wrapping up this list would be the song that's been in my playlist for 6 years already (and counting): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw"> You Belong With Me</a>. I'm pretty much the most fickle-minded person you'd ever meet so I change favorites and interests like how I change clothes. For a song to not leave my phones' playlists throughout the years would be really something special. I guess it's because it's the Taylor Swift song style that I fell in love with: the lyrics telling a story you can relate to, the right mix of pop and country music, the awards it had won, and the sincerity of the song itself. I also have some pretty good (and bad) memories with this song and I guess that's why it's very special to me through the years. </p>
