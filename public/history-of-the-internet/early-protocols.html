					With the proposed solution brought about by Paul Beran's Galactic Network by Licklider,  there were quite a number of factors which led to the internet's genesis and birth. Leonard Kleinrock's Packet Switching Theory in 1961 was also influential in the internet's origins. </p>

					Packet switching was simply "a packet of data, which included both its origin and destination, [that] could be sent from one location to the other." This simple idea was a big discovery and huge revelation at that time because the capabilities of technology was very much limited. Data, at that time, travelled using phone company circuits. A unique characteristic of the packet switching technology was that a packet of data can be sent again by the sender, in case of data loss in its travel path. While packets of data being sent which included the origin and destination was a big improvement over the current circuit system used by the telephone company another component of creating the internet that resembles the one used today was the idea that a decentralized system of computers (a network) could communicate with one another. During the 1960's there were many experiments that tried to create productive and efficient networks of computers. If you remember, at this time, computers were very specialized machines and some were huge taking up an entire room. In 1965 an experiment took place in which a TX-2 computer that was located in Massachusetts connected with a Q-32 computer in California. This experiment was successful and it is considered to this day to be the first time a connection of two computers was made using a low speed dial up phone line. The experiment specifically proved that not only can two computers connect to one another, but it also demonstrated that computers can both exchange programs and data with each other. While the experiment was successful, it was clear that the current set of telephone circuits were not practical and that packet switching technology would be needed to advance this technology.
